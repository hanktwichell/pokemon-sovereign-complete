# HeartGold's features (step 5)

The features the owner kept (`docs/Roadmap.md`, "HeartGold features"), as they work here, and what's left of each.

## Kurt's Apricorn Balls

Kurt in Azalea Town makes Poké Balls from Apricorns, which grow on 31 trees across Johto and Kanto, one a day each.

- **Trees.** HeartGold's Apricorn trees are people on the map running its `std_apricorn_tree` script, with the tree's
  number in their first parameter (HeartGold's `sTreeApricorns`, `src/apricorn_tree_sys.c`, gives each its colour).
  `tools/complete/import_hgss_events.py` gives them `CommonScript_CompleteApricornTree`
  (`res/field/scripts/scripts_common.s`, common script 0x80F) and, until HeartGold's sprites come in, Platinum's Cut
  tree as a stand-in (its berry soil, the first stand-in, showed Sinnoh's berry patches). The script is HeartGold's
  with its text (in `common_strings.json`): a tree gives its Apricorn once a day to a player with the Apricorn Box. A
  picked tree's flag (`COMPLETE_APRICORN_TREE_FLAGS_START`, past HeartGold's and Sacred Gold's flags) is cleared with
  the daily flags.
- **Apricorns** are bag items (the Items pocket), where HeartGold keeps them in the Apricorn Box. The box is still the
  key item Kurt gives, which lets the player pick them, as in HeartGold.
- **Kurt.** Where HeartGold opens its Apricorn Box, the bag opens on the Items pocket: Kurt takes all of the kind of
  Apricorn the player picks (up to 99) and has as many Balls of its kind the next day (Red: Level, Yellow: Moon,
  Blue: Lure, Green: Friend, Pink: Love, White: Fast, Black: Heavy). He keeps them in two vars, on the two Sacred Gold
  left unused (`VAR_COMPLETE_KURT_BALL`, `VAR_COMPLETE_KURT_QUANTITY`). The commands are in
  `src/complete_apricorns.c`.
- **Daily flags.** HeartGold's 192 daily flags (Kurt making Balls, the haircut brothers, Union Cave's Lapras on
  Fridays, Buena's password, the Trainer House, the Bug-Catching Contest) weren't cleared each day; they are now, with
  Sinnoh's (`FieldSystem_ClearDailyFlags`).

Left: **the Balls can't be thrown yet.** They are items (from HeartGold's list), but not battle items: throwing one
needs its catch rule (Level, Lure, Moon, Love, Heavy, Fast and Friend each have HeartGold's), its graphics in battle
and on the summary screen, and somewhere in the Pokémon's data to keep it (HeartGold has a byte for its own Balls;
Platinum's ball field only knows its 16). That comes with the sprites. Also left: Kurt's phone calls (with the
Pokégear), HeartGold's tree and Apricorn sprites, and the Apricorn juice stand, which is the skipped Pokéathlon's.
